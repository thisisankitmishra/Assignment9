        "Question 1: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y) using a straight line.\n",
        "Its purpose is to understand the relationship between variables and to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable.\n",

        "Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression are:\n",
        "1. Linearity – The relationship between X and Y must be linear.\n",
        "2. Independence – Observations must be independent of each other.\n",
        "3. Homoscedasticity – Constant variance of errors.\n",
        "4. Normality – Errors should be normally distributed.\n",
        "5. No outliers – No extreme values should affect the model.\n",

        "1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
        "2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared errors.\n",
